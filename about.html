            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>One of the most important child rights is the right to an education. As a result, this website serves to make education more accessible by making it easier to study on one's own. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the biggest problems that I faced in preparing for the CSEC examinations was how difficult it was to start revising. CXC Prep was thus created to hopefully make it easier for students to study by making revision with past papers more approachable.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "second">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>One of the most effective ways to revise is to do past papers, however, it's quite daunting to open a past paper booklet and start doing past papers just like that. Thus this website tries to make it easier for others to revise by allowing students to target specific topics as opposed to doing an entire past paper at a time. This is done by students choosing a topic that they would like to study and getting all the past paper questions that cover that topic.</p>
        </div>        

        <div id = "third">
            <h2>How to use?</h2>
            <p>To find questions of a specific topic simply: go to the <a href="index.html#csec">subject's page</a>, select the topic from the filter by checking its checkbox and unchecking the checkboxes of the topics that you don't want to see (this can be done easily by selecting 'none' and then the topic of choice) and then scroll below to see the questions that deal with that specific topic.</p>
        </div>
